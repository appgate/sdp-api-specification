      Appliance will download the Upgrade image and wait for the "complete" call before starting the Upgrade.
      The appliance will be functional until the "complete" call is made.
      "GET appliances/{id}/upgrade" must return "status":"idle|failed" before accepting the complete command.
      The progress can be followed by polling the appliance via "GET appliances/{id}/upgrade".

      This will stop the Controller and other services which may be affected by the Upgrade.
      "GET appliances/{id}/upgrade" must return "status":"ready" before accepting the complete command.
      The progress can be followed by polling the appliance via "GET appliances/{id}/upgrade".
      Unless "switchPartition" field is sent as true, the appliance will stay in the same partition,
      waiting for the "POST appliances/{id}/switch-partition" request to finalize the Upgrade.

      "GET appliances/{id}/upgrade" must return "status":"success" before accepting the complete command.
      Since the appliance will be rebooted, the status cannot be queried directly.
      The Upgrade Script utilizes the Appliance Status dashboard APIs to verify the status after this.
